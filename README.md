# Enhancing Climate Action with Advanced Environmental Data Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to enhance climate action through advanced analysis of environmental data, focusing on air quality indicators. By leveraging machine learning and data visualization techniques, we can derive meaningful insights to support environmental policies and initiatives.

## Repository Contents

- `enhancing_climate_action_advanced_environmental_data_analysis.py`: Python script for data analysis and machine learning model implementation.
- `AQI Data Set.csv`: Dataset containing Air Quality Index (AQI) data used for analysis.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Data visualization for insights
- Recommendations based on analysis

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/enhancing_climate_action.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd enhancing_climate_action
```

3. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the Python script to perform data analysis and model training:

```bash
python enhancing_climate_action_advanced_environmental_data_analysis.py
```

2. The script will output data visualizations and model evaluation metrics.

## Dataset

The `AQI Data Set.csv` file contains the following columns:

- Date
- City
- AQI
- AQI Category
- PM2.5
- PM10
- NO2
- SO2
- CO
- O3
